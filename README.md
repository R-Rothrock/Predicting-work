# Predicting-work
Simple linear regression model regarding data as to when my brother works. Still pretty
far from having enough data to make it any useful. When the data is usable, though, I
will be sure to add visualization methods to the model.

## Abstract
My brother has a very unpredictable schedule. He claims that it, in no way, could be
predicted. I disagree, to the extent that I intend to prove him wrong as a project I
could work on before school starts.

## Method
Using Python's `tensorflow` library, I took the time to learn and apply linear regression
techniques in order to analyze and predict my brother's schedule. My linear regression
model is stored in `model.ipynb`

## Results
With only two weeks of data for training, and two columns pasted into the testing data, I
got the following ammount of loss reduction per epoch:
